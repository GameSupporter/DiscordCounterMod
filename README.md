This is a mod that mutes every other sound in your mic even when you're talking so it only takes in your voice, so if you're typing on your keyboard while talking the, other person you're talking to is not going to hear the keyboard but her you.

It works better with better microphones. You can disable all of it with a button, and mute/unmute specific sounds.
This is still in **_ALPHA_** but i've only added features that works fine, so you won't experience any bugs.
It will go into Beta soon, sometime in the end of Mars and will have more features.
