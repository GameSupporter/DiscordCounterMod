This is a mod created that can mute specific types of sound so you can't hear others keyboard or you can mute the specific sounds on your mic. It will mute the specific sounds even when you're talking so it only hears the voice.

It works better with better microphones. You can disable all of it with a button, and mute/unmute specific sounds.
This is still in **_ALPHA_** but i've only added features that works fine, so you won't experience any bugs.
It will go into Beta soon, sometime in the end of Mars and will have more features.
